    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Coca-Cola is a trademarked brand and recipe for a popular carbonated soft
      drink. The original recipe for Coca-Cola is a closely guarded trade secret
      known only by a select few individuals within the company. However, there
      are a number of "clone" or copycat recipes available online that claim to
      replicate the taste of Coca-Cola. It's important to note that these
      recipes may not be exact replicas and that the company does not endorse or
      support the making of homemade versions of Coca-Cola.
      <br />
      Keep in mind this recipe is not the original and the company does not
      endorse or support the making of homemade versions of Coca-Cola.
