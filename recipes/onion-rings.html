    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Onion rings are a popular fast food and casual dining item, consisting of
      sliced onions that have been coated in a seasoned flour or batter and
      deep-fried until crispy and golden brown. They are often served as a side
      dish or appetizer, and can be accompanied by a variety of dipping sauces,
      such as ranch, ketchup, or barbecue sauce. The onions are typically sliced
      into thick or thin rings, depending on the recipe or personal preference.
      The coating can range from a simple flour or breadcrumb mixture to a more
      complex batter, which can include ingredients such as beer or buttermilk.
      Onion rings can be made with any type of onion, but sweet onions are
      particularly well suited for this dish because of their natural sweetness
      and mild flavor.
