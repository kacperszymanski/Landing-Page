    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a type of Italian dish made with layers of flat pasta,
      typically lasagna noodles, meat or vegetables, and a cheese and
      tomato-based sauce. The dish is then baked in the oven until the cheese is
      melted and bubbly. Traditional lasagna is made with meat sauce, but there
      are also vegetarian versions that use vegetables such as spinach or
      eggplant in place of meat. The dish can also be made with different types
      of cheese, such as ricotta or mozzarella, and can be served with a variety
      of side dishes, such as garlic bread or a green salad.Lasagna is a type of
